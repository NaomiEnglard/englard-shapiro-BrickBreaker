# englard-shapiro-BrickBreaker
Spring 2016 group project BRICK BREAKER 


BRICK BREAKER game
Goal: destroy all the bricks
How to play:
  the ball will always move, the direction it moves will change when the ball has a collision (with a wall, paddle, or brick)
  when a ball hits a brick the brick will disappear 
  Your Job is to use the right and left arrow key to move the paddle at the bottom to make sure the ball does not reach the floor.
  If the ball goes bellow the paddle you loose one of your 4 lives.
  
  To take a break in the middle of the game use the p and r button respectively to pause and resume the game.
  
HAVE FUN!!
